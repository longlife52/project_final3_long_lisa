## Resources
To create the map, I attempted to follow [this Google Maps APIs tutorial.](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map) After several glitches, I then opted for an iframe version.

I used a jQuery plugin [called mmenu](http://mmenu.frebsite.nl/documentation/core/) to create the hamburger menu. This plug in functions on all pages and is in the top left header bar.

This is the jQuery plugin [called Strip](http://www.stripjs.com/) for the video on the menu page. Fairly straightforward to install once I spotted in dev tools how to add the image file for the close buttons. In the error message, the path it was looking for was spelled out!  I just created the path it wanted. css>strip-skins>strip>close.svg.

Took me a while to get the jQuery plugin  [Backstretch](http://www.jquery-backstretch.com/) to work. My issue was with a background/background-color on the body. Once I removed it in CSS, I was golden. The plugin is used on all pages as the background.

Hooray! I used Bower for the first time to download + install a jQuery plugin called [Lazy Load](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload) which was super easy to get up and running. Note: On img tag must change src to data-original in html. Lazy load applies to all images in the project.

Here's a nice reminder [article on how to make images circles.](http://sixrevisions.com/css/circular-images-css/) Easiest if the image is a square to start.  If for some reason, I start with a rectangle, this article explains how to make it a circle.

This is an easy to follow resource from W3.org on [centering things.](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html)

Here's a wonderful [ghost-button tutorial](http://sixrevisions.com/css/ghost-buttons/) like the one on the menu.html page.

The custom JavaScript code appears on the menu.html page near the bottom. On page load, an ad box appears. The user may click it off. I referred to [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp). As well, I also followed a tutorial in a book called Javascript by Tom Negrino and Dori Smith.

For the custom jQuery code, I [referred to this article](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_dom_add.asp) on using after(). As well, for a quick refresher, I reviewed [this article](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_events.asp) on jQuery events.
