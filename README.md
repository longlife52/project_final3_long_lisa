## Resources
To create the map, I attempted to follow [this Google Maps APIs tutorial.](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map) After several glitches, I then opted for an iframe version.

I used a jQuery plugin[called Drawer](http://git.blivesta.com/drawer/)to create the hamburger menu.
