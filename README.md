## Resources
To create the map, I attempted to follow [this Google Maps APIs tutorial.](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map) After several glitches, I then opted for an iframe version.

I used a jQuery plugin [called mmenu](http://mmenu.frebsite.nl/documentation/core/) to create the hamburger menu.

This is the jQuery plugin [called Strip](http://www.stripjs.com/)for the video on the menu page.

## Deductions
